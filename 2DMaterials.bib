  Abstract                 = {Graphene is an important material for sensing and energy storage applications. Since the vast majority of sensing and energy storage chemical and electrochemical systems require bulk quantities of graphene{,} thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) is commonly employed instead of pristine graphene. The sp2 planar structure of TRGO is heavily damaged{,} consisting of a very short sp2 crystallite size of nanometre length and with areas of sp3 hybridized carbon. Such a structure of TRGO is reminiscent of the key characteristic of the structure of amorphous carbon{,} which is defined as a material without long-range crystalline order consisting of both sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbons. Herein{,} we describe the characterization of TRGO{,} its parent graphite material and carbon black (a form of amorphous carbon) via transmission electron microscopy{,} Raman spectroscopy{,} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry experiments. We used the data obtained as well as consideration of practical factors to perform a comparative assessment of the relative electrochemical performances of TRGO against amorphous carbon. We found out that TRGO and amorphous carbon exhibit almost identical characteristics in terms of density of defects in the sp2 lattice and a similar crystallite size as determined by Raman spectroscopy. These two materials also exhibit similar amounts of oxygen containing groups as determined by XPS and nearly indistinguishable cyclic voltammetric response providing almost identical heterogeneous electron transfer constants. This leads us to conclude that for some sensing and energy storage electrochemical applications{,} the use of amorphous carbon might be a much more economical solution than the one requiring digestion of highly crystalline graphite with strong oxidants to graphite oxide and then thermally exfoliating it to thermally reduced graphene oxide.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Graphene is a material with outstanding properties that make it an excellent candidate for advanced applications in future electronics and photonics. The potential of graphene in high-speed analog electronics is currently being explored extensively because of its high carrier mobility, its high carrier saturation velocity, and the insensitivity of its electrical-transport behavior to temperature variations. Herein, we review some of the key material and carrier-transport physics of graphene, then focus on high-frequency graphene field-effect transistors, and finally discuss graphene monolithically integrated circuits (ICs). These high-frequency graphene transistors and ICs could become essential elements in the blossoming fields of wireless communications, sensing, and imaging. After discussing graphene electronics, we describe the impressive photonic properties of graphene. Graphene interacts strongly with light over a very wide spectral range from microwaves to ultraviolet radiation. Most importantly, the light–graphene interaction can be adjusted using an electric field or chemical dopant, making graphene-based photonic devices tunable. Single-particle interband transitions lead to a universal optical absorption of about 2 percent per layer, whereas intraband free-carrier transitions dominate in the microwave and terahertz wavelength range. The tunable plasmonic absorption of patterned graphene adds yet another dimension to graphene photonics. We show that these unique photonic properties of graphene over a broad wavelength range make it promising for many photonic applications such as fast photodetectors, optical modulators, far-infrared filters, polarizers, and electromagnetic wave shields. These graphene photonic devices could find various applications in optical communications, infrared imaging, and national security. },

Here, ion implantation is used to create uniform impurity-atom densities which are both dose and spatially controlled within multiwalled carbon nanotubes and graphene. The technique is demonstrated for a range of dopants, including silver, representing a likely candidate for optical enhancement, and boron, which is predicted to introduce a plasmon within the visible-frequency regime. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy performed within an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, in combination with high-angle-annular-dark-field imaging, is used to pinpoint and identify the bonding configuration of single foreign species within the matrix.},

Atomic resolution high-angle dark field imaging (HAADF) combined with single-atom electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy reveals that for sufficiently low implantation energies ions are predominantly substitutionally incorporated into the graphene lattice with a very small fraction residing in defect-related sites.},

implantation enables a precise control of the carbon content and of the uniformity of the
in-plane carbon concentration in the Ni films before annealing, we observe thickness
non-uniformities in the synthesized graphene layers after high temperature annealing. These
non-uniformities are probably induced by the heterogeneous distribution/topography of the
graphene nucleation sites on the Ni surface. Taken altogether, our results indicate that the
number of graphene layers on top of Ni films is controlled by the nucleation process on the Ni
surface rather than by the carbon content in the Ni film.},

We provide here a brief review of graphene growth on metals, a subject with a rich history even before the recent explosion of interest in graphene. The current activities related to graphene growth on metals have been motivated by the need to develop low-cost, scalable processes for graphene synthesis and to understand how graphene–metal interfaces behave in devices. In this article, we examine the current state of the art, emphasizing the basic processes that distinguish graphene growth from normal crystal growth. },

It was developed for determining ion range and damage distributions as well as angular and energy distributions of backscattered and transmitted ions. The computer program provides particularly high computer efficiency, while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy. This is achieved mainly by applying a new analytic formula for determining nuclear scattering angles based on the Molière potential, and by suitably expanding the distance between collisions at high energies. With these improvements it becomes feasible for the first time to assess accurately both low and high energy problems with high precision using a single simulation program. },

Suspension ~150 nm above a Si/SiO2 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching. The specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current-induced heating, directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport. Concomitant with large mobility enhancement, the widths of the characteristic Dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional, nonsuspended devices. This advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene. },

  Abstract                 = {Current methods of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of graphene on copper are complicated by multiple processing steps and by high temperatures required in both preparing the copper and inducing subsequent film growth. Here we demonstrate a plasma-enhanced CVD chemistry that enables the entire process to take place in a single step, at reduced temperatures (<420C), and in a matter of minutes. Growth on copper foils is found to nucleate from arrays of well-aligned domains, and the ensuing films possess sub-nanometre smoothness, excellent crystalline quality, low strain, few defects and room-temperature electrical mobility up to (6.0+/-1.0) x 104 cm2 V-1 s-1, better than that of large, single-crystalline graphene derived from thermal CVD growth. These results indicate that elevated temperatures and crystalline substrates are not necessary for synthesizing high-quality graphene.},

  Abstract                 = {We study, within the tight-binding approximation, the electronic properties of a graphene bilayer in the presence of an external electric field applied perpendicular to the system—a biased bilayer . The effect of the perpendicular electric field is included through a parallel plate capacitor model, with screening correction at the Hartree level. The full tight-binding description is compared with its four-band and two-band continuum approximations, and the four-band model is shown to always be a suitable approximation for the conditions realized in experiments. The model is applied to real biased bilayer devices, made out of either SiC or exfoliated graphene, and good agreement with experimental results is found, indicating that the model is capturing the key ingredients, and that a finite gap is effectively being controlled externally. Analysis of experimental results regarding the electrical noise and cyclotron resonance further suggests that the model can be seen as a good starting point for understanding the electronic properties of graphene bilayer. Also, we study the effect of electron–hole asymmetry terms, such as the second-nearest-neighbour hopping energies t' (in-plane) and \gamma 4 (inter-layer), and the on-site energy \delta.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Graphene has emerged as an intriguing and attractive functional material for a wide range of applications, owing to its unique physical, chemical and mechanical properties. Herein, we report large-scale production of high quality single crystalline graphene sheets based on the ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method using acetylene (C2H2) as the carbon source and coral-like iron with body-centered-cubic structure as the catalyst. The process can be scaled up for large quantity production at a low cost. The optimum APCVD temperature has been identified to be 850C, which is much lower than that catalyzed by other metals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy characterizations show the single crystalline and high quality nature of the as-prepared graphene produced by the bottom-up APCVD approach. A new horizontal “dissolution–deposition–growth” mechanism is proposed and verified by high resolution TEM. When applied as anode materials in lithium ion batteries, graphene sheets exhibited a high lithium storage capacity and an excellent cyclability. The capability of preparing crystalline graphene on a large scale with low cost opens an avenue for technological applications of graphene in many fields. },

  Abstract                 = {A study of resonant Raman spectroscopy of the as-grown graphene on copper foils is presented. Different laser energies have been used to excite the sample, in order to obtain the dependence of the Raman features (intensities, frequencies and line widths) on the laser energy. We show that the normalised spectra acquired using green laser lines are more intense, with a maximum around 2.3 eV. Moreover, the results show a broader 2D (or G') band when a UV laser is used to excite the sample, which is explained by the manifestation of the trigonal warping effect in the dispersion of electrons and phonons around the Dirac point. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Cu thin films is a promising approach for the large area formation of graphene on dielectric substrates, but a fine control of the deposition parameters is required to avoid dewetting of the Cu catalyst. In this paper we report on the study of the Cu dewetting phenomena by monitoring the intensity of the infra-red emission from the film surface during rapid thermal \{CVD\} of graphene. The reduction of Cu film coverage consequent to dewetting is detected as a variation of sample's emissivity. Results indicate three time constants of dewetting, describing three typical stages, hole formation, propagation and ligament breakup. Slowing the first incubation stage by tuning pressure in the chamber allows for an effective surface activation resulting in the deposition of graphene at temperatures lower than those in the case of Cu foils. },

  Abstract                 = {Ion irradiation of a graphene sheet can give rise to a wide range of point and extended defects on the ideal honeycomb lattice. Here we perform first-principles calculations for the determination of the electronic and transport properties of damaged graphene nanoribbons based on nonequilibrium Green function techniques. Considering a wide range of defects (vacancies, di-vacancies, Stone–Wales, sp3-type) we study the conductive characteristics, showing that the common feature in all cases is the presence of transport gaps induced by local perturbations of the wavefunction around the defected areas. However, the resonances of these pseudogaps are intrinsically related to the defect type, making possible a structural characterization of a defected graphene system based on its electrical behavior. },

This review discusses advances that have been made in the study of defect-induced double-resonance processes in nanographite, graphene and carbon nanotubes, mostly coming from combining Raman spectroscopic experiments with microscopy studies and from the development of new theoretical models. The disorder-induced peak frequencies and intensities are discussed, with particular emphasis given to how the disorder-induced features evolve with increasing amounts of disorder. We address here two systems, ion-bombarded graphene and nanographite, where disorder is represented by point defects and boundaries, respectively. Raman spectroscopy is used to study the {\textquoteleft}atomic structure{\textquoteright} of the defect, making it possible, for example, to distinguish between zigzag and armchair edges, based on selection rules of phonon scattering. Finally, a different concept is discussed, involving the effect that defects have on the lineshape of Raman-allowed peaks, owing to local electron and phonon energy renormalization. Such effects can be observed by near-field optical measurements on the G' feature for doped single-walled carbon nanotubes.

  Abstract                 = { In this work we explore the kinetics of single-crystal graphene growth as a function of nucleation density. In addition to the standard methods for suppressing nucleation of graphene by pretreatment of Cu foils using oxidation, annealing, and reduction of the Cu foils prior to growth, we introduce a new method that further reduces the graphene nucleation density by interacting directly with the growth process at the onset of nucleation. The successive application of these two methods results in roughly 3 orders of magnitude reduction in graphene nucleation density. We use a kinetic model to show that at vanishingly low nucleation densities carbon incorporation occurs by a cooperative island growth mechanism that favors the formation of substrate-size single-crystal graphene. The model reveals that the cooperative growth of millimeter-size single-crystal graphene grains occurs by roughly 3 orders of magnitude increase in the reactive sticking probability of methane compared to that in random island nucleation. },

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Graphene, a single atom–thick plane of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, has captivated the attention of physicists, materials scientists, and engineers alike over the five years following its experimental isolation. Graphene is a fundamentally new type of electronic material whose electrons are strictly confined to a two-dimensional plane and exhibit properties akin to those of ultrarelativistic particles. Graphene's two-dimensional form suggests compatibility with conventional wafer processing technology. Extraordinary physical properties, including exceedingly high charge carrier mobility, current-carrying capacity, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity, make it an enticing candidate for new electronic technologies both within and beyond complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS). Immediate graphene applications include high-speed analog electronics and highly conductive, flexible, transparent thin films for displays and optoelectronics. Currently, much graphene research is focused on generating and tuning a bandgap and on novel device structures that exploit graphene's extraordinary electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. },

  Abstract                 = { Large-area single-layer graphenes with high crystallinity are desired for electronic applications. Here we demonstrate a continued growth method to amplify an existing graphene seed, originally grown by chemical vapor deposition, by preferentially inducing nucleation at seed edges. More specifically, this approach involves a surface oxidation step after the first growth, which leads to the observed formation of oxides at the vicinity of graphene edges, along with the inevitable formation of cracks due to oxidation, and thus limit growth predominantly at those edges, as a consequence of the reduced energy barrier of methane decomposition by oxygen moieties. Consequently, we successfully grow millimeter-size secondary single-crystal graphene structures with the same lattice structure and orientation as the original seeds. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Raman spectroscopy characterization, along with electronic transport measurement confirmed the structure coherence after the regrowth, even in the seed/regrown grains boundary region. This clone-like method provides a venue for production of graphene electronics with reproducible properties. },

Careful optimization of the supported carbon clusters, CN (with size N ranging from 1 to 24), on the Ni(111) surface indicates a ground state structure transformation from a one-dimensional C chain to a 2D sp2 C network at N ~ 10--12. Furthermore, the crucial parameters controlling graphene growth on the metal surface, nucleation barrier, nucleus size, and nucleation rate on a terrace or near a step edge are calculated. In agreement with numerous experimental observations, our analysis shows that graphene nucleation near a metal step edge is superior to that on a terrace. On the basis of our analysis, we propose the use of graphene seeds to synthesize high-quality graphene in large area. },

Simultaneous or subsequent heat treatment is performed in the 450–600C range. The carbon dose was set to be 4 equivalent graphene monolayers (EGM). Most of the carbon implanted diffuses directly to the surface, forming multi-layer graphene (MLG). A progressive structuration of these graphitic fragments occurs with the increase of the implantation temperature. However, this structuration is more pronounced if the thermal treatment is performed in situ following the carbon implantation at room temperature. The mean \{MLG\} thickness, corresponding to around 4–5 EGM, was measured by angular X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy. Moreover, the overall carbon concentration inside and at the limits of the nickel films, determined by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), is in the 7–10 \{EGM\} range. This concentration depends on the temperature but it exceeds surprisingly the expected carbon concentration. This discrepancy shows that some carbon is incorporated along the different steps. \{NRA\} analyses of the preparation confirm this point. To obtain large film, the presented results stress the interest to better understand the full system carbon–nickel in the preparation of \{MLG\} at each step of the process.

Flat copper surface was prepared by using a chemical mechanical polishing method. At early growth stage, the density of graphene nucleation seeds from polished Cu film was much lower and the domain sizes of graphene flakes were larger than those from unpolished Cu film. At later growth stage, these domains were stitched together to form monolayer graphene, where the orientation of each domain crystal was unexpectedly not much different from each other. We also found that grain boundaries and intentionally formed scratched area play an important role for nucleation seeds. Although the best monolayer graphene was grown from polished Cu with a low sheet resistance of 260 ohm/sq, a small portion of multilayers were also formed near the impurity particles or locally protruded parts. },

We discovered that oxygen (O) on the Cu surface substantially decreased the graphene nucleation density by passivating Cu surface active sites. Control of surface O enabled repeatable growth of centimeter-scale single-crystal graphene domains. Oxygen also accelerated graphene domain growth and shifted the growth kinetics from edge-attachment–limited to diffusion-limited. Correspondingly, the compact graphene domain shapes became dendritic. The electrical quality of the graphene films was equivalent to that of mechanically exfoliated graphene, in spite of being grown in the presence of O.},

  Abstract                 = {Graphene layers, prepared by mechanical exfoliation, were contacted by superconducting electrodes consisting of a titanium–aluminium bilayer. Quantum hall measurements in the normal state confirmed the single layer nature of the graphene samples. Proximity induced supercurrents were observed in all samples, below 1 K. Using a backgate, the Fermi energy could be swept from valence to conduction band via the Charge neutrality point, demonstrating supercurrents carried by holes and electrons, respectively. Interestingly, a finite supercurrent was also observed at the charge neutrality (or Dirac) point, where the density of carrier states vanishes. Our results demonstrate phase coherence in graphene. },

  Abstract                 = { Integrated manufacturing is arguably the most challenging task in the development of technology based on graphene and other 2D materials, particularly with regard to the industrial demand for “electronic-grade” large-area films. In order to control the structure and properties of these materials at the monolayer level, their nucleation, growth and interfacing needs to be understood to a level of unprecedented detail compared to existing thin film or bulk materials. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has emerged as the most versatile and promising technique to develop graphene and 2D material films into industrial device materials and this Perspective outlines recent progress, trends, and emerging CVD processing pathways. A key focus is the emerging understanding of the underlying growth mechanisms, in particular on the role of the required catalytic growth substrate, which brings together the latest progress in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis and classic crystal/thin-film growth. },

This newly grown RGO possesses lower defect density with larger and increased distribution of sp2 domains than chemically reduced RGO. Furthermore this method without optimization reduces the relative standard deviation of electrical conductivity between chips, from 80.5 percent to 16.5 percent, enabling RGO to be used in practical electronic devices.},

  Abstract                 = { van der Waals epitaxial growth of graphene on c-plane (0001) sapphire by CVD without a metal catalyst is presented. The effects of CH4 partial pressure, growth temperature, and H2/CH4 ratio were investigated and growth conditions optimized. The formation of monolayer graphene was shown by Raman spectroscopy, optical transmission, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), and low voltage transmission electron microscopy (LVTEM). Electrical analysis revealed that a room temperature Hall mobility above 2000 cm2/V·s was achieved, and the mobility and carrier type were correlated to growth conditions. Both GIXRD and LVTEM studies confirm a dominant crystal orientation (principally graphene [10–10] || sapphire [11–20]) for about 80–90 percent of the material concomitant with epitaxial growth. The initial phase of the nucleation and the lateral growth from the nucleation seeds were observed using atomic force microscopy. The initial nuclei density was ~24 um–2, and a lateral growth rate of ~82 nm/min was determined. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the binding between graphene and sapphire is dominated by weak dispersion interactions and indicate that the epitaxial relation as observed by GIXRD is due to preferential binding of small molecules on sapphire during early stages of graphene formation. },

Graphene is a material with enormous potential for numerous applications. Therefore, significant efforts are dedicated to large-scale graphene production using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. In addition, research is directed at developing methods to incorporate graphene in established production technologies and process flows. In this paper, we present a brief review of available CVD methods for graphene synthesis. We also discuss scalable methods to transfer graphene onto desired substrates. Finally, we discuss potential applications that would benefit from a fully scaled, semiconductor technology compatible production process.

  Abstract                 = {Copper foil is the most common substrate to synthesize monolayer graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The surface morphology and conditions of the copper foil can be very different depending on the various suppliers or different batches. These surface properties of copper strongly affect the growth behavior of graphene, thus rendering the growth conditions irreproducible when different batches of Cu foil are used. Furthermore, the quality of the graphene is severely affected as well. In this work, we report a facile method of copper pre-cleaning to improve the graphene quality and the reproducibility of the growth process. We found that the commercial Ni etchant (based on nitric acid) or nitric acid is the most effective cleaning agent among various acidic or basic solutions. The graphene grown on thus-treated copper surfaces is very clean and mostly monolayer when observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical imaging, as compared to the graphene grown on untreated copper foil. Different batches (but with the same catalog number) of copper foil from Alfa Aesar Company were examined to explore the effect of copper pre-cleaning; consistent growth results were obtained when pre-cleaning was used. This method overcomes a commonly encountered problem in graphene growth and could become one of the standard protocols for preparing the copper foil substrate for growing graphene or other 2D materials.},

  Abstract                 = { As the technology for diamond film preparation by plasma-assisted CVD and related procedures has advanced, Raman spectroscopy has emerged as one of the principal characterization tools for diamond materials. Cubic diamond has a single Raman-active first order phonon mode at the center of the Brillouin zone. The presence of sharp Raman lines allows cubic diamond to be recognized against a background of graphitic carbon and also to characterize the graphitic carbon. Small shifts in the band wavenumber have been related to the stress state of deposited films. The effect is most noticeable in diamond films deposited on hard substrates such as alumina or carbides. The Raman line width varies with mode of preparation of the diamond and has been related to degree of structural order. The Raman spectrum of hexagonal diamond (lonsdaleite) is distinct from that of the cubic diamond and allows it to be recognized. },

The effect of deposition temperature onto the formation of graphene layers is investigated. Raman spectra showed the characteristic features of sp2 bonded carbon atoms; G band, D band and 2D band. The line shape of 2D band structure and the relative intensities of G and 2D bands were used to estimate the number of graphene layers. The graphene layers deposited via \{PLD\} at room temperature has I2D/IG ratio ~0.33, confirming the formation of multilayer whereas that of deposited at substrate temperature 700&#xa0;C is ~0.47 confirming the formation of less than five layers of graphene; few layers graphene. The decrease in separation of subpeaks of 2D band with deposition temperature further confirms the reduction in the number of layers of graphene from ~10 deposited at room temperature to less than 5 layers at that of 700&#xa0;C. The surface morphology of the deposited samples was recorded by field emission scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. },

The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m-1) and –690 Nm-1, respectively. The breaking strength is 42 Nm-1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = -2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of $\sigma_{int}$ = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

The anisotropic twofold symmetry of the germanium (110) surface allowed unidirectional alignment of multiple seeds, which were merged to uniform single-crystal graphene with predefined orientation.

  Abstract                 = { Graphene is, in many ways, a simple substance. Made of a single atomic layer of graphite, graphene has emerged as a material providing many surprises and having immense scientific and industrial potential. In 2010, scientists Andre K. Geim and Konstantin S. Novoselov received the Nobel Prize in Physics for their isolation of graphene and for their research pertaining to the ultrathin material. In his presentation speech, Professor Per Delsing described how we all have made graphene each time we write with a pencil: microscopic bits of graphite and graphene flake away as the pencil moves across the paper (Delsing 2010). It was Geim and Novoselov's ability to point and say “there,” however, that has gained them fame. Since graphene's isolation, scientists have been discovering its surprising properties including its strength, flexibility, and high mobility of its charge carriers, properties that will undoubtedly lead to many industrial applications. This article will give an introduction to the importance of graphene and an analysis of when and where graphene has appeared in scholarly literature. },

The lateral growth of such single crystal graphene islands was studied by carbon isotope labeling and Raman spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. By changing the concentration of G-O in the aqueous dispersion used to deposit the G-O flakes onto the Cu foil by dip-coating, the size of the seeded graphene islands could be precisely controlled on the Cu foil. The crystal orientation of the single crystal graphene islands was found to be identical to that of the G-O seeds. },

  Abstract                 = {Graphene has been attracting great interest because of its distinctive band structure and physical properties. Today, graphene is limited to small sizes because it is produced mostly by exfoliating graphite. We grew large-area graphene films of the order of centimeters on copper substrates by chemical vapor deposition using methane. The films are predominantly single-layer graphene, with a small percentage (less than 5 percent) of the area having few layers, and are continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries. The low solubility of carbon in copper appears to help make this growth process self-limiting. We also developed graphene film transfer processes to arbitrary substrates, and dual-gated field-effect transistors fabricated on silicon/silicon dioxide substrates showed electron mobilities as high as 4050 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Graphene came to the forefront in the nanosciences in the early 2000s, in particular, when high-quality graphene with atomic thickness and two-dimensional extension in the micrometer range was isolated and the resulting novel electronic properties were demonstrated. Graphene has two unique features: lateral size up to tens of micrometers or larger and quantum confinement in an atomically thin sheet. It provides an excellent platform for exploring novel material properties, designing new materials, and enhancing material performance. Now, after extensive research for nearly a decade, graphene research has moved well beyond electronic applications and has begun to extend into a wide variety of disciplines. This expanded issue of MRS Bulletin is focused on graphene and consists of 20 articles and three commentaries that collectively address the major impact of graphene on materials science, highlight the newest advances, discuss challenging issues, explore applications, and reveal future directions.},

  Abstract                 = {Monolayer graphene exhibits many spectacular electronic properties, with superconductivity being arguably the most notable exception. It was theoretically proposed that superconductivity might be induced by enhancing the electron–phonon coupling through the decoration of graphene with an alkali adatom superlattice [Profeta G, Calandra M, Mauri F (2012) Nat Phys 8(2):131–134]. Although experiments have shown an adatom-induced enhancement of the electron–phonon coupling, superconductivity has never been observed. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we show that lithium deposited on graphene at low temperature strongly modifies the phonon density of states, leading to an enhancement of the electron–phonon coupling of up to \dots},

  Abstract                 = {Recent Raman scattering studies in different types of graphene samples are reviewed here. We first discuss the first-order and the double resonance Raman scattering mechanisms in graphene, which give rise to the most prominent Raman features. The determination of the number of layers in few-layer graphene is discussed, giving special emphasis to the possibility of using Raman spectroscopy to distinguish a monolayer from few-layer graphene stacked in the Bernal (AB) configuration. Different types of graphene samples produced both by exfoliation and using epitaxial methods are described and their Raman spectra are compared with those of 3D crystalline graphite and turbostratic graphite, in which the layers are stacked with rotational disorder. We show that Resonance Raman studies, where the energy of the excitation laser line can be tuned continuously, can be used to probe electrons and phonons near the Dirac point of graphene and, in particular allowing a determination to be made of the tight-binding parameters for bilayer graphene. The special process of electron–phonon interaction that renormalizes the phonon energy giving rise to the Kohn anomaly is discussed, and is illustrated by gated experiments where the position of the Fermi level can be changed experimentally. Finally, we discuss the ability of distinguishing armchair and zig-zag edges by Raman spectroscopy and studies in graphene nanoribbons in which the Raman signal is enhanced due to resonance with singularities in the density of electronic states. },

The dependence of graphene synthesis on process conditions, including the carbon implantation dose, RTA temperature, and time, were investigated. The graphene shows quality comparable to that of the best reported CVD graphene. It was also found that local growth of graphene through local implantation requires stringent control of the process chamber conditions in order to avoid growth of graphene on unimplanted regions.},

  Abstract                 = {There are few phenomena in condensed matter physics that are defined only by the fundamental constants and do not depend on material parameters. Examples are the resistivity quantum, h/e2 (h is Planck's constant and e the electron charge), that appears in a variety of transport experiments and the magnetic flux quantum, h/e, playing an important role in the physics of superconductivity. By and large, sophisticated facilities and special measurement conditions are required to observe any of these phenomena. We show that the opacity of suspended graphene is defined solely by the fine structure constant, a = e2/hc 1/137 (where c is the speed of light), the parameter that describes coupling between light and relativistic electrons and that is traditionally associated with quantum electrodynamics rather than materials science. Despite being only one atom thick, graphene is found to absorb a significant (pa = 2.3 percent) fraction of incident white light, a consequence of graphene's unique electronic structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Here we demonstrate the growth of transfer-free graphene on SiO2 insulator substrates from sputtered carbon and metal layers with rapid thermal processing in the same evacuation. It was found that graphene always grows atop the stack and in close contact with the Ni. Raman spectra typical of high quality exfoliated monolayer graphene were obtained for samples under optimised conditions with monolayer surface coverage of up to 40 percent and overall graphene surface coverage of over 90 percent. Transfer-free graphene is produced on SiO2 substrates with the removal of Ni in acid when Ni thickness is below 100 nm, which effectively eliminates the need to transfer graphene from metal to insulator substrates and paves the way to mass production of graphene directly on insulator substrates. The characteristics of Raman spectrum depend on the size of Ni grains, which in turn depend on the thickness of Ni, layer deposition sequence of the stack and \{RTP\} temperature. The mechanism of the transfer-free growth process was studied by \{AFM\} in combination with Raman. A model is proposed to depict the graphene growth process. Results also suggest a monolayer self-limiting growth for graphene on individual Ni grains. },

  Abstract                 = { Here we report a transfer-free method of synthesizing bilayer graphene directly on SiO2 substrates by carbon diffusion through a layer of nickel. The 400 nm nickel layer was deposited on the top of SiO2 substrates and used as the catalyst. Spin-coated polymer films such as poly(methyl methacrylate), high-impact polystyrene or acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene, or gas-phase methane were used as carbon sources. During the annealing process at 1000C, the carbon sources on the top of the nickel decomposed and diffused into the nickel layer. When cooled to room temperature, bilayer graphene was formed between the nickel layer and the SiO2 substrates. The nickel films were removed by etchants, and bilayer graphene was then directly obtained on SiO2, eliminating any transfer process. The bilayer nature of the obtained graphene films on SiO2 substrates was verified by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The Raman spectroscopy mapping over a 100 × 100 um2 area indicated that the obtained graphene is high-quality and bilayer coverage is approximately 70 percent. },

The derived strain rate of the G band, as well as its intensity as a function of the strain direction and light polarization angle, are found in very good agreement with previous reports. The simulated 2D band shows a complex peak structure with two or three resolved subbands. The dependence of the strain rate and the Raman intensity of the latter on the strain direction and light polarization angle follows simple trigonometric expressions. Noticeable deviations from these expressions are observed for the polarization angle dependence. It is also shown quantitatively that the contribution to the 2D band of the “inner” processes is about 10 times larger than that of the “outer” processes. Our predictions for the 2D band behavior of strained graphene can be used for monitoring the strain in graphene-based applications by Raman spectroscopy. },

Over the past few years, the field has progressed well beyond the realisation of elementary devices, since active matrix displays driven by nanowire thin film transistors have been demonstrated, as well as the fabrication of medium scale integrated circuits based on random arrays of carbon nanotubes. Also, graphene, a new nanomaterial has appeared in the landscape; although it is a zero gap semiconductor, it can still be used to make transistors, provided narrow ribbons or bilayers are used. Graphene is also a serious contender for the replacement of oxide-based transparent conducting films.},

Here, we report that in a chemical vapor deposition process the carbon species dissociated on Cu surfaces not only result in graphene layers on top of the catalytic Cu thin films but also diffuse through Cu grain boundaries to the interface between Cu and underlying dielectrics. Optimization of the process parameters leads to a continuous and large-area graphene thin layers directly formed on top of the dielectrics. The bottom-gated transistor characteristics for the graphene films have shown quite comparable carrier mobility compared to the top-layer graphene. The proposed method allows us to achieve wafer-sized graphene on versatile insulating substrates without the need of graphene transfer. },

The lateral size of obtained GO sheets can be adjusted by the sonication period: it decreases with the increasing sonication time. The thin-film electrodes made from ultra large reduced GO sheets exhibit lower sheet resistance compared with those from small-size reduced GO sheets. Moreover, the transistor devices made from these single-layer GO sheets after 800C thermal reduction exhibit the effective hole mobility ranged between 4 and 12 cm2/(V s). Raman spectroscopic results suggest that the enhancement in mobility at a higher-mobility regime is well explained by the graphitization of GO rather than the removal of functional groups. The ratio between the 2D and G peak areas, I(2D)/I(G), is well correlated to the effective hole mobility values in reduced GO sheets. },

  Abstract                 = {Defects are usually seen as imperfections in materials that could significantly degrade their performance. However, at the nanoscale, defects could be extremely useful since they could be exploited to generate novel, innovative and useful materials and devices. Graphene and graphene nanoribbons are no exception. This review therefore tries to categorize defects, emphasize their importance, introduce the common routes to study and identify them and to propose new ways to construct novel devices based on ‘defective’ graphene-like materials. In particular, we will discuss defects in graphene-like systems including (a) structural (sp 2 -like) defects, (b) topological (sp 2 -like) defects, (c) doping or functionalization (sp 2 - and sp 3 -like) defects and (d) vacancies/edge type defects (non-sp 2 -like). It will be demonstrated that defects play a key role in graphene physicochemical properties and could even be critical to generate biocompatible materials. There are numerous challenges in this emerging field, and we intend to provide a stimulating account which could trigger new science and technological developments based on defective graphene-like materials that could be introduced into other atomic layered materials, such as BN, MoS 2 and WS 2 , not discussed in this review.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A detailed review of the literature for the last 5–10 years on epitaxial growth of graphene is presented. Both experimental and theoretical aspects related to growth on transition metals and on silicon carbide are thoroughly reviewed. Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of growth on all these materials, where possible, are discussed. To make this text useful for a wider audience, a range of important experimental techniques that have been used over the last decade to grow (e.g. CVD, \{TPG\} and segregation) and characterize (STM, LEEM, etc.) graphene are reviewed, and a critical survey of most important theoretical techniques is given. Finally, we critically discuss various unsolved problems related to growth and its mechanism which we believe require proper attention in future research. },

  Abstract                 = {Low-energy ion beam modification was proposed to create graphene on the top of the insulated diamond-like carbon (DLC) films. In such low-temperature process the surface of the amorphous carbon could crystallize to graphene as a result of point defect creation and enhanced diffusion caused by the ion bombardment. In the experiment 130&#xa0;eV argon ion irradiation was used. After the modification the resistivity of the sample surface drops and the underlying \{DLC\} remained highly insulating. Raman spectra of the samples measured at 633&#xa0;nm showed partial crystallization and were similar to the spectra of defected graphene. This result is very encouraging and we hope that by improving this technology it will be possible to fabricate defect-free graphene, which can be used in electronics without transfer to other substrates. },

  Abstract                 = { Chemical vapor deposition of graphene on Cu often employs polycrystalline Cu substrates with diverse facets, grain boundaries (GBs), annealing twins, and rough sites. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron-backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and Raman spectroscopy on graphene and Cu, we find that Cu substrate crystallography affects graphene growth more than facet roughness. We determine that (111) containing facets produce pristine monolayer graphene with higher growth rate than (100) containing facets, especially Cu(100). The number of graphene defects and nucleation sites appears Cu facet invariant at growth temperatures above 900 °C. Engineering Cu to have (111) surfaces will cause monolayer, uniform graphene growth. },

  Abstract                 = {A brief review is given regarding the application of cluster ion beams as desorption probes in molecular SIMS. The general observation is that the efficiency of secondary ion formation, particularly that of complex molecular species, is significantly enhanced if polyatomic projectiles are employed instead of atomic species. Apart from the sensitivity increase, cluster bombardment also appears to allow for molecular depth profiling studies without the accompanying damage accumulation normally associated with atomic projectiles. A few fundamental aspects are addressed in an attempt to highlight the physics behind these observations. It appears that much of the benefit associated with cluster bombardment is connected to the fact that these projectiles give access to very high sputter yields which are not accessible with atomic primary ions. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the principles and experimental status of gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) processing as a promising surface modification technique for practical industrial applications. Theoretical and experimental characteristics of \{GCIB\} processes and of related equipment development are described from the moment of neutral cluster formation, through ionization, acceleration and impact upon a surface. The impact of an accelerated cluster ion upon a target surface imparts very high energy densities into the impact area and produces non-linear effects that are not observed in the impacts of atomic ions. Unique characteristics of \{GCIB\} bombardment have been found to offer potential for various industrial applications that cannot be achieved by conventional ion beam processing. Among prospective applications are included shallow ion implantation, high rate sputtering, surface cleaning and smoothing, and low temperature thin film formation. Sputtering effects produced by cluster ion impact are particularly interesting. High sputtering yields and lateral distribution of sputtered atoms cause surface smoothing effects which cannot be achieved with monomer ion beams. Surface smoothing to atomic levels is expected to become the first production use of GCIB. },

  Abstract                 = { In this research, we constructed a controlled chamber pressure CVD (CP-CVD) system to manipulate graphene’s domain sizes and shapes. Using this system, we synthesized large (~4.5 mm2) single-crystal hexagonal monolayer graphene domains on commercial polycrystalline Cu foils (99.8 percent purity), indicating its potential feasibility on a large scale at low cost. The as-synthesized graphene had a mobility of positive charge carriers of ~11000 cm2 V-1 s–1 on a SiO2/Si substrate at room temperature, suggesting its comparable quality to that of exfoliated graphene. The growth mechanism of Cu-based graphene was explored by studying the influence of varied growth parameters on graphene domain sizes. Cu pretreatments, electrochemical polishing, and high-pressure annealing are shown to be critical for suppressing graphene nucleation site density. A pressure of 108 Torr was the optimal chamber pressure for the synthesis of large single-crystal monolayer graphene. The synthesis of one graphene seed was achieved on centimeter-sized Cu foils by optimizing the flow rate ratio of H2/CH4. This work should provide clear guidelines for the large-scale synthesis of wafer-scale single-crystal graphene, which is essential for the optimized graphene device fabrication. },

Alternatively, the carbon feeds can be prepared from a self-assembled monolayer of butyltriethoxysilane atop a SiO2 layer. The carbon feedstocks were deposited on the insulating substrates and then caped with a layer of nickel. At 1000 °C, under low pressure and a reducing atmosphere, the carbon source was transformed into a bilayer graphene film on the insulating substrates. The Ni layer was removed by dissolution, affording the bilayer graphene directly on the insulator with no traces of polymer left from a transfer step. The bilayer nature of as-grown samples was demonstrated by IG/I2D Raman mapping, the statistics of the full-width at half-maximum of the Raman 2D peak, the selected area electron diffraction patterns over a large area, and randomly imaged graphene edges by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. },

  Abstract                 = { As a two-dimensional (2D) sp2-bonded carbon allotrope, graphene has attracted enormous interest over the past decade due to its unique properties, such as ultrahigh electron mobility, uniform broadband optical absorption and high tensile strength. In the initial research, graphene was isolated from natural graphite, and limited to small sizes and low yields. Recently developed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques have emerged as an important method for the scalable production of large-size and high-quality graphene for various applications. However, CVD-derived graphene is polycrystalline and demonstrates degraded properties induced by grain boundaries. Thus, the next critical step of graphene growth relies on the synthesis of large graphene single crystals.In this Account, we first discuss graphene grain boundaries and their influence on graphene’s properties. Mechanical and electrical behaviors of CVD-derived polycrystalline graphene are greatly reduced when compared to that of exfoliated graphene. We then review four representative pathways of pretreating Cu substrates to make millimeter-sized monolayer graphene grains: electrochemical polishing and high-pressure annealing of Cu substrate, adding of additional Cu enclosures, melting and resolidfying Cu substrates, and oxygen-rich Cu substrates. Due to these pretreatments, the nucleation site density on Cu substrates is greatly reduced, resulting in hexagonal-shaped graphene grains that show increased grain domain size and comparable electrical properties as to exfoliated graphene. Also, the properties of graphene can be engineered by its shape, thickness and spatial structure. Thus, we further discuss recently developed methods of making graphene grains with special spatial structures, including snowflakes, six-lobed flowers, pyramids and hexagonal graphene onion rings. The fundamental growth mechanism and practical applications of these well-shaped graphene structures should be interesting topics and deserves more attention in the near future. Following that, recent efforts in fabricating large single-crystal monolayer graphene on other metal substrates, including Ni, Pt, and Ru, are also described. The differences in growth conditions reveal different growth mechanisms on these metals. Another key challenge for graphene growth is to make graphene single crystals on insulating substrates, such as h-BN, SiO2, and ceramic. The recently developed plasma-enhanced CVD method can be used to directly synthesize graphene single crystals on h-BN substrates and is described in this Account as well.To summarize, recent research in synthesizing millimeter-sized monolayer graphene grains with different pretreatments, graphene grain shapes, metal catalysts, and substrates is reviewed. Although great advancements have been achieved in CVD synthesis of graphene single crystals, potential challenges still exist, such as the growth of wafer-sized graphene single crystals to further facilitate the fabrication of graphene-based devices, as well as a deeper understanding of graphene growth mechanisms and growth dynamics in order to make graphene grains with precisely controlled thicknesses and spatial structures. },

Both doping and compressive strain (as verified by transmission electron microscope) contribute to the shift of Raman peaks, while both doping and lattice defects contribute to the attenuation of 2D peak. Finally, the nature of defects in \{NG\} was probed and found that they are boundary defects. The detail analysis of the evolution of Raman spectra in \{NG\} would greatly help on the characterization and future application of this novel material. },

The active species for graphene growth should thus mainly be CHx instead of atomic carbon.

  Abstract                 = {Graphene was prepared by negative \{C4\} cluster ion implantation at 5&#xa0;keV/atom followed by vacuum thermal annealing and cooling. The surface morphology and structure of samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Improvement of the graphene quality was realized by optimization of the post thermal processes. 1–2 layer graphene was obtained with I2D/IG ratio of 1.43 and ID/IG ratio of 0.07 at the implantation dose of 12&#xa0;×&#xa0;1015&#xa0;atoms/cm2 and annealed at 900&#xa0;°C followed by cooling at 20&#xa0;°C/min. },

  Abstract                 = {{SRIM} is a software package concerning the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter. Since its introduction in 1985, major upgrades are made about every six years. Currently, more than 700 scientific citations are made to {SRIM} every year. For SRIM-2010, the following major improvements have been made: (1) About 2800 new experimental stopping powers were added to the database, increasing it to over 28,000 stopping values. (2) Improved corrections were made for the stopping of ions in compounds. (3) New heavy ion stopping calculations have led to significant improvements on {SRIM} stopping accuracy. (4) A self-contained {SRIM} module has been included to allow {SRIM} stopping and range values to be controlled and read by other software applications. (5) Individual interatomic potentials have been included for all ion/atom collisions, and these potentials are now included in the {SRIM} package. A full catalog of stopping power plots can be downloaded at www.SRIM.org. Over 500 plots show the accuracy of the stopping and ranges produced by {SRIM} along with 27,000 experimental data points.
